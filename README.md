## How this repo is organised

Each `sessionN-*/` folder holds the course notes and demo files for that session.
Your homework for a session goes in its `task/` folder:

```
sessionN-topic/
  session-notes.md        course material
  task/
    README.md             your write-up: commands, output, what you learned
    screenshots/          your own screenshots
```

Session 6–7 has two separate assignments, so it has both a `task/` folder and a `Task-2/`
folder.

Every `task/README.md` is an empty template. Fill in the sections as you do each task -
the "Problems I hit" section is worth writing honestly, it is the part you will actually
reread later.

## Getting started

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) - it covers making this repo your own and publishing it to your
GitHub account.

## Screenshot tooling (optional)

[`tools/`](tools/) has a small Playwright-based helper for capturing proof of your work:
browser screenshots of a page your container is really serving, and typeset renders of
real terminal output. See [tools/README.md](tools/README.md). It is entirely optional -
ordinary screenshots are fine.
